Description:
hotplugd - Android Service that listen to kernel events using the UEVENT Socket

Purpose:
Mainly developed to handle usb_modeswitch and connection management for Huawei USB Dongles ( Usb Vendor ID:12d1 )
can be easily repurposed to handle any kernel level event.

For hotplugd to function the following prerequisite must be met

1. a usb_modeswitch data directory must exists at one of the following locations
/system/etc/usb_modeswitch 
/system/etc/usb_modeswitch.d
/etc/usb_modeswitch 

2. the files in the usb_modeswitch directory must be named in the following format
vendorid:productid e.g 12d1:1446

3. a system service named switch_ms_to_3g must be defined - this executes the usb_modeswitch binary
   and passes the vendorid, productid (as discovered by the uevent poll) and the full path to the
   configuration file
   
4. a system service named ril-daemon must defined - this is start when a tty device name ttyUSB2 is 
   created, this may be better fired off when a wwan device is created instead
